Hangman Game – Fruit Edition
A Python console game built during my 10-week IntrnForte internship.
The player guesses letters to reveal a random fruit name within limited attempts.
This project helped me improve Python logic, loops, conditions and user interaction handling.

Tech Used: Python
Features:

random fruit word selection
live guess tracking
input validation
win/lose game state

Future Enhancements:

GUI version using Tkinter or PyGame
difficulty levels
word categories
